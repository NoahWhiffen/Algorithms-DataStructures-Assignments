 * An Animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" bases.
 * People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of  all animals at the shelter, or they can select
 *  whether they would prefer a dog or cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).
 *  They cannot select which specific animal they would like.
 *  Create a datastucture to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and DequeueCat.
